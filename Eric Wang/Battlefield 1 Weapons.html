    		<h2 style="color: white">There are six categories of weapons.</h2>
   			 <p class="one" style="color: white">There are your Shotguns (great for blasting enemies from up close), SMGs (made for short range rapid-fire), LMGs (amazing at tearing things apart from medium range), Semi Autos (balanced and powerful), Sidearms (great in a pinch), and Sniper Rifles (which do exactly what you think).</p>

 	 	<div class="column.middle">
    		<h2 style="color: white">There's a ton of variety.</h2>
    		<p class="two" style="color: white">Each weapon type has multiple different weapons to choose from. The weapons of the era were incredibly varied. In fact, many of the weapons of World War I were the first successful versions of those weapons. The first SMGs and Automatic Rifles were deployed during the era, and you can use them in Battlefield 1.</p>

  		<div class="column.right">
    		<h2 style="color: white">Weapon customization is more focused.</h2>
    		<p class="three" style="color: white">We definitely want to allow you to customize your weapons in Battlefield 1, but we also heard your feedback that we should try to find a way to do this without adding hundreds of additional attachments. That's why Battlefield 1 utilizes pre-set Loadouts for each weapon - you're still able to customize your weapons to make sure they work with your playstyle, but in a more focused way.</p>
